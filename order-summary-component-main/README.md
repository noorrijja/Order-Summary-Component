### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS

### What I learned

- learned a little more about responsive designs min(), max(), and clamp() functions.

### Continued development

While working on future projects I would like giving a boost to my responsive web design skills as well as improving the accessibilty of the design.
